      "answer": "To enter the United States in F-1 status, you must carry a valid passport (valid for at least six months beyond entry), a valid F-1 visa, your original Form I-20 signed by a DSO, and proof of SEVIS fee payment. These documents are required by DHS and CBP for entry."
    },
    {
      "qid": 2,
      "answer": "No. F-1 students may not enter the United States more than 30 days before the program start date listed on the Form I-20. This limit is set by DHS regulations."
    },
    {
      "qid": 3,
      "answer": "No. Form I-20 is not 'activated' at the border. CBP admits the student in F-1 status, and the SEVIS record becomes active after the school reports registration to SEVP."
    },
    {
      "qid": 4,
      "answer": "Yes. Although not specifically required by regulation, CBP may request proof of financial ability at the port of entry. Carrying financial documents is recommended because it assists with verifying nonimmigrant intent and funding."
    },
    {
      "qid": 5,
      "answer": "A valid visa is required only for entry to the United States. If your F-1 visa expires while you are inside the U.S., you may remain as long as you maintain lawful F-1 status. A valid visa is required only for reentry after travel abroad."
    },
    {
      "qid": 6,
      "answer": "Yes. USCIS permits F-1 students to bring dependents in F-2 status. Each dependent must have a separate Form I-20 issued for them and must apply for an F-2 visa to enter the U.S."
    },
    {
      "qid": 7,
      "answer": "USCIS does not mandate health insurance for F-1 students before arrival. However, many schools require insurance as an enrollment condition. Federal law only requires health insurance for J-1/J-2, not F-1/F-2."
    },
    {
      "qid": 8,
      "answer": "Your SEVIS ID number is printed on the Form I-20 issued by your school. It begins with the letter 'N' and is assigned by SEVP when your school creates your SEVIS record."
    },
    {
      "qid": 9,
      "answer": "No. F-1 students may not work immediately upon arrival. On-campus employment is allowed only after the program start date. Off-campus employment is prohibited without prior authorization such as CPT or OPT."
    },
    {
      "qid": 10,
      "answer": "USCIS does not regulate arrival-week activities. However, SEVP requires schools to report registration in SEVIS at the start of the academic term. Students must complete school check-in procedures to maintain status."
    },
    {
      "qid": 11,
      "answer": "You may apply for CPT only after completing one full academic year in valid F-1 status, unless your graduate program requires immediate training. This requirement is set by federal CPT regulations."
    },
    {
      "qid": 12,
      "answer": "Yes. CPT must be directly related to your major field of study. This requirement is defined in SEVP guidance and DHS regulations for curricular training."
    },
    {
      "qid": 13,
      "answer": "Yes. Part-time CPT (20 hours or fewer per week) is permitted during the academic term if authorized by your DSO and required by your curriculum. This is allowed by DHS regulations."
    },
    {
      "qid": 14,
      "answer": "USCIS does not process CPT; schools issue CPT authorization. Processing time varies by school as CPT is an institutional decision, not a USCIS adjudication."
    },
    {
      "qid": 15,
      "answer": "Yes. A job offer is required for CPT because your DSO must enter employer information into SEVIS before authorizing training. CPT cannot be granted without a specific employer."
    },
    {
      "qid": 16,
      "answer": "Yes, but only if each position is integral to your curriculum and separately authorized for CPT in SEVIS. There is no federal restriction on multiple CPT employers, but each must meet CPT eligibility rules."
    },
    {
      "qid": 17,
      "answer": "CPT does not affect OPT eligibility unless you engage in 12 months or more of full-time CPT. Federal regulations state that 12+ months of full-time CPT eliminates OPT eligibility. Part-time CPT does not affect OPT."
    },
    {
      "qid": 18,
      "answer": "CPT documentation typically includes your Form I-20 with CPT authorization on page 2 and any school-required forms. USCIS does not adjudicate CPT, so the required documents are determined by the school."
    },
    {
      "qid": 19,
      "answer": "No. Students may not begin CPT employment until the CPT authorization appears on page 2 of the Form I-20. Working before authorization is considered unauthorized employment under DHS regulations."
    },
    {
      "qid": 20,
      "answer": "There is no federal limit on total CPT duration. However, accumulating 12 months of full-time CPT eliminates OPT eligibility. Part-time CPT does not count toward this limit."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "qid": 23,
      "answer": "No. A job offer is not required to apply for OPT. USCIS allows students to request OPT without securing employment."
    },
    {
      "qid": 24,
      "answer": "OPT processing time varies, but USCIS typically takes 1–3 months to adjudicate Form I-765 for OPT. USCIS does not guarantee processing times."
    },
    {
      "qid": 25,
      "answer": "Yes, but travel while OPT is pending carries risk. USCIS permits travel while the OPT application is pending, but reentry may be denied without an issued EAD and job offer letter. USCIS warns of these risks."
    },
    {
      "qid": 26,
      "answer": "If OPT is denied, the student loses eligibility to work under OPT. SEVP guidance states the student may remain in the U.S. during the grace period or consider other options such as reinstatement or departing the country."
    },
    {
      "qid": 27,
      "answer": "No. If you have engaged in 12 months or more of full-time CPT, you are ineligible for OPT. This restriction is defined in federal F-1 employment regulations."

    {
      "qid": 28,
      "answer": "OPT applications require Form I-765, a new Form I-20 with OPT recommendation, passport photos, filing fee, and supporting identity documents. These requirements are listed by USCIS for Form I-765 eligibility."
    },
    {
      "qid": 29,
      "answer": "USCIS allows students to use any valid mailing address for Form I-765. However, the address must be one where the student can reliably receive mail. USCIS mails the EAD card to the address on the I-765."
    },
    {
      "qid": 30,
      "answer": "No. OPT allows only employment directly related to the student’s major field of study. Freelance or self-employment is allowed only if it is related to the field. Irrelevant freelance work is not permitted."
    },
    {
      "qid": 31,
      "answer": "Yes. A U.S. degree in computer science qualifies for the STEM OPT extension because it appears on the DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List."
    },
    {
      "qid": 32,
      "answer": "Students may apply for STEM OPT up to 90 days before their OPT end date. USCIS requires that the application be filed before the initial OPT period expires."

      "qid": 34,
      "answer": "Form I-983 is the training plan required for the STEM OPT extension. It must be completed jointly by the student and employer, describing training goals and evaluations, as required by DHS for STEM OPT compliance."
    },
    {
      "qid": 35,
      "answer": "Yes. Students may change employers during STEM OPT if the new employer is E-Verify enrolled and a new Form I-983 is submitted. DHS requires a new training plan for each employer."

    },
    {
      "qid": 43,
      "answer": "Yes. Unpaid volunteer work may count toward employment on OPT if it is directly related to the student’s major and involves at least 20 hours per week. This is allowed under DHS employment guidance."
    },

      "qid": 44,
